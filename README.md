# Responsive Screenshot Tool #

<http://castlegateit.github.io/cgit-rwd-screenshot/>

A simple tool to help take portfolio screenshots of responsive websites.
Requires a modern browser with JavaScript enabled. This does not actually
_take_ a screenshot (you will still need a browser plugin for that) but it
does help with the size and layout.

Tip: You will need to resize the screen shots to around 650px in width for the online portfolio.
